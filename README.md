Customer overall train experience

Customer Overall Train Experience README file

Introduction
The purpose of this project is to predict the overall experience of customers in a train based on their demographic and travel information, as well as their ratings on various aspects of the train experience. The dataset used for this project contains 94379 observations and 26 features. The target feature is "Overall_Experience", which ranges from 0 to 5.

Dataset Description
There are two datasets used in this project: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv dataset contains 94379 entries with 9 features, including the target variable 'Overall_Experience'. The test.csv dataset has 36000 entries and the same features as the train.csv except for the target variable. The features in the dataset are as follows:

ID: Unique identification number of the passenger.
Gender: Gender of the passenger.
Customer_Type: Type of customer (Loyal or disloyal).
Age: Age of the passenger.
Type_Travel: Purpose of the travel.
Travel_Class: Class of travel (Eco, Business or Eco Plus).
Travel_Distance: Distance of travel in km.
Departure_Delay_in_Mins: Delay in departure time in minutes.
Arrival_Delay_in_Mins: Delay in arrival time in minutes.
Seat_Comfort: Rating of seat comfort (1-5).
Seat_Class: Rating of seat class (1-5).
Arrival_Time_Convenient: Rating of the arrival time convenience (1-5).
Catering: Rating of catering service (1-5).
Platform_Location: Rating of platform location (1-5).
Onboard_Wifi_Service: Rating of onboard wifi service (1-5).
Onboard_Entertainment: Rating of onboard entertainment (1-5).
Online_Support: Rating of online customer support (1-5).
Ease_of_Online_Booking: Rating of ease of online booking (1-5).
Onboard_Service: Rating of onboard service (1-5).
Legroom: Rating of legroom (1-5).
Baggage_Handling: Rating of baggage handling (1-5).
CheckIn_Service: Rating of check-in service (1-5).
Cleanliness: Rating of cleanliness (1-5).
Online_Boarding: Rating of online boarding (1-5).
Overall_Experience: Rating of overall experience (0-5).

Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the overall experience of train customers. The objectives are to:

	Clean and preprocess the data
	Analyze the data to identify any trends or patterns
	Select the most relevant features for the model
	Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data
	Evaluate the performance of the model using cross-validation
	Make predictions on a test set

Preprocessing

The dataset was preprocessed by first handling missing values by imputing correlated missing values between Departure_Delay_in_Mins and Arrival_Delay_in_Mins. Rows with missing values in certain columns with little missing values were removed, while outliers were also removed by the 3-standard deviation rule.

The data preprocessing steps include:

Imputing missing values in the "Departure_Delay_in_Mins" and "Arrival_Delay_in_Mins" columns
Removing rows with missing values in certain columns
Removing outliers from the data
Selecting only the relevant features for the model

Feature Engineering

Some features were removed in order to simplify the dataset for modeling. The removed features include: Departure_Delay_in_Mins, Seat_Comfort, Catering, Platform_Location, Onboard_Wifi_Service, Onboard_Entertainment, Online_Support, Arrival_Time_Convenient, Ease_of_Online_Booking, Onboard_Service, Legroom, Baggage_Handling, CheckIn_Service, Cleanliness, and Online_Boarding.
Methodology
The methodology used in this project involves:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify any trends or patterns
Feature Engineering to create new features from the existing ones that may be more relevant for the model
Feature Selection to identify the most important features for the model
Model Selection to choose the best machine learning model for the data
Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize the performance of the chosen model
Cross-Validation to evaluate the performance of the model

Analysis
The analysis conducted in this project includes:

EDA using data visualization techniques to gain insights into the data and identify any trends or patterns
Feature Importance analysis to identify the most important features for the model
Model evaluation using cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model

Model

The model used for this project is a Random Forest Classifier, which achieved an accuracy of 0.952 (0.002) using cross-validation. The trained model was then used to make predictions on the test.csv dataset, and the results were saved to a CSV file.

Proposed Future Model
In future work, more advanced machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting or Deep Learning could be explored to improve the performance of the model. Additionally, more data could be collected to further improve the accuracy of the model.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the developed machine learning model for predicting the overall experience of train customers achieved a high accuracy of 0.952. The key features that significantly impacted the model's prediction were identified as "Travel_Distance", "Age", "Departure_Delay_in_Mins", and "Arrival_Delay_in_Mins". These findings can be used to improve customer satisfaction and experience by identifying and addressing the areas that most impact customer perception.
